# Nagivator for Smart Cities: Front-End Adaptor 

This project contains the front-end adaptor code for a car navigator for smart cities. The repository which contains the client code (Android) is [here](https://github.com/Fiware/showcase.smartcity.carNavigator) 

This adaptor exposes REST interfaces which are called by the Android application. The implementation behind those REST interfaces invokes FIWARE NGSI APIs to get access to data offered by different context information servers of the cities involved on the show case.
